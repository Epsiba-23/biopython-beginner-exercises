# BIOPYTHON BEGINNER EXERCISE

## Overview:
Welcome to the Biopython Beginner Exercises repository! This repository is designed for individuals looking to practice and enhance their skills in bioinformatics using Biopython. It contains several Jupyter notebooks that guide users through various basic operations in Biopython, along with the necessary datasets and output files from the code runs.

## Repository Structure
### Datasets_Biopython/: 
This folder contains all the datasets required for the exercises.
### Module1_biopython.ipynb:
The first module introduces the basics of Biopython and provides exercises for hands-on practice.
### Module2_Biopython.ipynb:
The second module builds upon the first, exploring more advanced Biopython features and operations.
### Module3_Biopython.ipynb: 
The third module focuses on specific applications of Biopython, allowing users to implement their knowledge.

## Getting Started
To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository: 
Clone this repository to your local machine or directly open it in Google Colab.

### Load Datasets:
Download the datasets from the Datasets_Biopython/ folder and upload them to your Google Drive.

### Mount Google Drive:
If you are using Google Colab, make sure to mount your Google Drive in your notebook. You can do this by running the following code snippet in a cell:

python- Copy code: DONE TO ALL MODULE NOTEBOOK.
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
 ```

### Access the Datasets: 
Use the path /content/drive/MyDrive/ followed by the path to your datasets in your code to access them.

### Run the Code:
Execute the cells in the Jupyter notebooks to practice the various Biopython functionalities.

### Output Files
The notebooks will generate output files based on the exercises and operations performed. Make sure to check the corresponding output files for the results of your code runs.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a practical resource for anyone interested in learning and practicing Biopython. Feel free to explore the notebooks, experiment with the code, and enhance your bioinformatics skills!
